All other known bugs and fixes can be sent to *"zinjadsaurabh1997@gmail.com"* with the subject *"GeekGang Suggestion"*.

Reported bugs/fixes will be submitted to correction.

## Basic Idea :
To learn and get hands-on knowledge about the "DotNet Software Development Framework", I created a Web application project which is a technical event hosting and attending platform for everyone. Users can get to know about technical events happening in any location and can organize events.

## Features :
1. Explore Meets: Users can see all events and register for the same.
2. Host Meets: Users can organize an event. Also, User has the access to update, delete and other admin-like privileges.

## Performed Operations:
1. CRUD Operations.
2. Entity Framework.
3. Data Annotations.
4. Pagination.
5. Grid View.
6. Error Handling
7. jQuery.

## How to run file :
To implement this project on your Machine
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create Database in "SQL Server" using SQL Queries given in [**`Create and Design Database`**](./2.%20Create%20and%20design%20database/SQL%20queries).
3. Then open [**`GeekGang.sln`**](./3.%20GeekGang/GeekGang.sln) file from **`GeekGang`** folder and run it.

## Bugs :

## Limitation and Further growth : 
1. Need to add jQurey Ajax.
2. Need to implement sorting and filtering on `all meetup` view.
